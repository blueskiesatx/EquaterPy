# EquatorPy
This is a python approach to using api for weather in cities and their relative temperature. There is a short version and a longer version. The difference is that the long version works better and has a sample size of 500 cities from citipy. Take a look at copy2 for the improvements.

Tools used: matplotlib, pyplot, pandas, numpy, json, and openweathermapy.core
